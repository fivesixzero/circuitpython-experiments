    "# APDS-9960 Color Data Playground\n",
    "\n",
    "Processing the APDS-9960 color data is interesting, since it provides both RGB data and clear data. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's cool and all, but a lot of use cases call for two specific types of data that can also be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Color Temperature (CT)\n",
    "* Lux (ambient light level)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Color Engine Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding to this is the complexity of sensing color data, due a few key tuning options for the color engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Integration Time\n",
    "    * `ATIME` (8-bit value with 255 options)\n",
    "* Gain\n",
    "    * `CONTROL<AGAIN>` (2-bit value with 4 options)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Color Engine Interrupts\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the sensor's interrupt pin can be used to alert the host device to two different types of interrupt conditions. Both are triggered by results from the clear channel, ignoring the R/G/B values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sensor's interrupt pin can also be assrted when `AINT` or `ASAT` are triggered.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clear channel values below over a threshold window\n",
    "    * `AINT`, controlled by low (`AILTL`/`ALHTL`) and high (`AILTH`/`AIHTH`) thresholds.\n",
    "    * Asserts int pin if `ENABLE<AIEN>` is true\n",
    "* Clear channel analog circuit saturation \n",
    "    * `ASAT`\n",
    "    * Asserts int pin if `CONFIG2<CPSIEN>` is true\n",
    "\n",
    "The `AINT` interrupt can be useful for handling light-change conditions, like detecting lights turning on or off, detecting sunrise/sunset, or \n",
    "\n",
    "The `ASAT` interrupt can be useful for, for instance, responsively tuning the sensor's `AGAIN` to respond to saturation conditions caused by exceptionally bright lighting conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These can be cleared via `CICLEAR` and are also cleared by the broader `AICLEAR`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Color Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The data available from the sensor is provided in four 16-bit values from its ADC, which reads in four photodiodes masked with R, G, B and \"clear\" masks. This is quite different from the proximity and gesture engines, which only offer 8-bit values.\n",
    "\n",
    "These become available in four two-byte (high/low) registers. When new data is available, `AVALID` flips to true. `AVALID` becomes reset whenever any of the data registers are read.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Processing Color Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting CT/Lux from the RGB/C data is a bit involved though. The \"clear\" channel could be useful for lux but its results are heavily variable based on integration time and gain settings. Similiarly, the R/G/B values can vary widely based on integration time and gain.\n",

    "\n",
    "However, the ratio between the R/G/B values can give us the data we need for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few different ways to go about calculating CCT from RGB. Arduino libraries for this sensor and others like it tend to reuse the same basic code which was well-Pythonized in the original APDS-9960 driver within `colorutil`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what that looks like in `colorutil`."
